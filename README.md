## Adding/updating a conference

To keep things minimal, I'm only looking to list top-tier conferences in AI as per [conferenceranks.com][6]. Feel free to maintain a separate fork if you don't see your sub-field or conference of interest listed.

To add or update information:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `name`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place` attributes
- Send a pull request
